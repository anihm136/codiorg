* CodiOrg

This is a hard fork of CodiOrg, with the intent to replace the MD internals with [[https://github.com/orgapp/orgajs][Orga]].

-----

CodiMD lets you collaborate in real-time with markdown. Built on
[[https://hackmd.io][HackMD]] source code, CodiMD lets you host and
control your team's content with speed and ease.

** HackMD

[[https://hackmd.io][HackMD]] helps developers write better documents
and build active communities with open collaboration. HackMD is built
with one promise - *You own and control all your content*: - You should
be able to easily [[https://hackmd.io/c/news/%2Fs%2Fr1cx3a3SE][download
all your online content at once]]. - Your content formatting should be
portable as well. (That's why we choose
[[https://hackmd.io/features#Typography][markdown]].) - You should be
able to control your content's presentation with HTML,
[[https://hackmd.io/p/slide-example][slide mode]], or
[[https://hackmd.io/c/book-example/][book mode]].

** CodiMD - The Open Source HackMD

CodiMD is the free software version of [[https://hackmd.io][HackMD]],
developed and opened source by the HackMD team with reduced features
(without book mode), you can use CodiMD for your community and own all
your data. /(See the
[[https://github.com/hackmdio/hackmd/issues/720][origin of the name
CodiMD]].)/

CodiMD is perfect for open communities, while HackMD emphasizes on
permission and access controls for commercial use cases.

HackMD team is committed to keep CodiMD open source. All contributions
are welcome!
